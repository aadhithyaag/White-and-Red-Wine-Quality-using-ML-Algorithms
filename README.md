Predicting White Wine and Red Wine Quality using Machine Learning Algorithms

This is a project I did for School last semester. <br/>
It is difficult to determine an empirical relation between the subjective quality of a wine and its chemical composition as taste is the least understood human taste. Wine brewers want to know what they can do to their processes to optimize the quality of their wine. All companies that sell wine want it to be of the best quality so that it can be used as a good promotion content amongst the public. While attempts have been made to build predictors for wine from chemical data, not all algorithms have been tested. In addition to testing algorithms and variations of algorithms to check for highest accuracy for prediction purposes, we are also interested in analyzing the data as well to conclude which feature of wine is important during production stages for ensuring good quality. <br/>

Machine Learning Algorithms which were trained and tested include: <br/>
**1. Logistic Regression.**<br/>
**2. Stochastic Gradient Descent.**<br/>
**3. Support Vector Machine.**<br/>
**4. Random Forest Classifier**<br/>

Boosting methods such as GridSearch CV were implemented. Random Forest Classifier gave an Accuracy of **91%** for **Red Wine** and **88%** for **White Wine** and stood out from the others.<br/>

Python language was used. matplotlib and seaborn packages were used for visualizing the datasets. sklearn package implememted to get objects of respective ML Algorithms.
